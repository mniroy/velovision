## Core Features

### Camera Management
- **Multi-camera support** — RTSP, ONVIF, and HTTP stream protocols
- **Stream URL Builder** — Auto-discovers stream URLs via ONVIF with manual override
- **Connection testing** — Validate camera feeds before saving
- **Live dashboard feeds** — Real-time snapshots from all cameras at a glance

### System Configuration
- **Unified Settings hub** — Manage system timezone, AI engine parameters, and service provider credentials in one place.
- **Service management** — Configure Google Gemini or OpenAI vision models with ease.
- **Configurable engine parameters** — Tune model selection, token limits, and temperature.


### Vision AI Tools
Advanced intelligence modules designed for specific home security and monitoring tasks:

#### Doorbell IQ
- **Visitor Analysis** — AI identifies who is at the door, their appearance, and suspicious behavior.
- **Package Detection** — Automated alerts for package deliveries and pickups.
- **Multi-Channel Alerts** — Smart notifications via WhatsApp (with image), Webhook, and MQTT.
- **Trigger Versatility** — Activate via physical doorbell button (MQTT), dedicated Webhook, or WhatsApp phrase.

#### Utility Meter
- **Multi-Meter Tracking** — Monitor multiple physical meters (Electricity, Water, Gas) simultaneously.
- **Optical Reading** — AI reads physical analog or digital digits from camera snapshots.
- **Flexible Scheduling** — Automated meter readings on Hourly or Daily intervals.
- **Digital Records** — Parses physical readings into digital values sent directly to your phone.

#### Home Patrol
- **Holistic property patrol** — AI reviews all cameras simultaneously and summarizes the state of the home.
- **Per-camera intelligence** — Custom review context and notification rules per camera.
- **Periodic scheduling** — Automated patrols on configurable intervals.

#### People Finder
- **Targeted Tracking** — Search all camera feeds specifically for registered individuals.
- **Arrival Alerts** — Get notified exactly when a family member or expected guest arrives home.

### WhatsApp Notifications (GOWA)
- **Real-time alerts** — Receive detection alerts on WhatsApp via the GOWA service
- **Recipient management** — Add individual contacts or group recipients
- **Configurable gateway** — Connect to your own GOWA WhatsApp gateway instance

### Event Timeline
- **Activity history** — Browse all detection events with timestamps and AI descriptions
- **Camera filtering** — Filter events by specific camera or view all
- **Date picker** — Navigate to any date in the event history
- **Event actions** — Download snapshots or delete events

### Face Recognition
- **Known person registry** — Add and categorize known individuals (Family, Friend, Neighbor, Courier, Staff)
- **Face encoding** — Upload photos to build recognition profiles
- **Category filtering** — Filter faces by category

### Analytics Dashboard
- **Detection charts** — Visualize activity trends over time (Week, Month, YTD, All)
- **Category breakdown** — Filter by detection categories
- **Event statistics** — Track total events and patterns

### Backup & Recovery (Integrated)
- **One-click backup** — Download a complete snapshot of your entire system configuration from the Settings hub.
- **Drag & drop restore** — Upload a backup file to restore cameras, AI config, WhatsApp settings, face database, and event history.
- **Data inventory** — Real-time system stats (cameras, AI provider, known faces, events) visible before backup.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- A Google Gemini API key (or OpenAI API key)
- IP cameras with RTSP/ONVIF/HTTP support (optional for initial setup)
- GOWA WhatsApp gateway instance (optional, for notifications)

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     velovision:
       image: mniroy/velovision:latest
       container_name: velovision
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       environment:
         - TZ=Asia/Jakarta
       volumes:
         - ./data:/data
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard:**
   Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

5. **Initial configuration:**
    - Navigate to **Settings** → Enter your Gemini or OpenAI API key
    - Navigate to **Cameras** → Add your camera streams
    - Navigate to **Messages** → Configure WhatsApp gateway (optional)
    - Navigate to **AI Patrol** → Set up patrol schedules



#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TZ` | Container timezone | `Asia/Jakarta` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Internal database URL | `http://localhost:8000` |

#### Volumes

| Mount | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `./data:/data` | Persistent storage for config, database, face data, event snapshots |
| `./src:/app/src` | Application source (enables hot-reload in development) |

## Security Notes

- The `data/` directory contains sensitive information (API keys, camera credentials, face data) and is **excluded from Git** via `.gitignore`.
- API keys are stored in `data/config.yaml` and only accessible within the container.
- Camera stream URLs may contain authentication credentials — these are never exposed in the UI.
- The application is designed for **local network deployment**. If exposing externally, use a reverse proxy with HTTPS and authentication.
